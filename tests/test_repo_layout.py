WHY THIS EXISTS
===============
Stage C died on every training and evaluation call with:

    ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'tcwpn.model'

The code was fine. The repository was not. Uploading files through the GitHub
web UI had produced:

    src/tcwpn/model.py       -> renamed to src/tcwpn/old_model_1.py
    scripts/train.py         -> a second copy at src/tcwpn/train.py
    scripts/train_1.py       -> the superseded copy, left in place

So `tcwpn.model` did not exist, and two stale duplicates of train.py sat where
an import could pick the wrong one. Nothing in the test suite noticed, because
every existing test imports `tcwpn.cohort`, `tcwpn.sampler`, `tcwpn.blinding`
and `tcwpn.indexing` — none of them touches `tcwpn.model`, which needs torch and
is therefore skipped in a CPU environment.

These tests import nothing heavy. They check that the files the pipeline calls
are present, in one place, and free of the `_1` / `old_` / `copy` suffixes that
web-UI uploads leave behind.

Run them FIRST, before any data stage.
